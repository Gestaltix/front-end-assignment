# Frontend Assignment

This assignment is a representation of my experience with React.

Even though I could have found a better time for it (Breaking it up before and after the holidays probably wasn't the best idea) I found it to be an interesting one. I used Redux and react router dom for this test.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
